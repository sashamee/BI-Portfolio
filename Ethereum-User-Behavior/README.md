# Ethereum User Behavior: New vs Returning Users

## Overview
This project analyzes user activity on the Ethereum network using on-chain transaction data.
The goal is to demonstrate why **Daily Active Users (DAU)** alone is insufficient and how
user composition and value-based metrics provide deeper insight into engagement.

## Key Questions
- How many users are active on Ethereum over time?
- Are active users primarily new or returning?
- Is activity driven by acquisition or retention?
- How much value does a typical active wallet move?

## Metrics Used
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- New vs Returning Users
- New User Share (%)
- Median ETH moved per active wallet (p50)

Median values are used to reduce distortion from whale activity.

## Key Insights
- DAU alone overstates engagement and hides churn.
- User composition explains DAU dynamics.
- High new-user share indicates acquisition-driven activity.
- Median-based metrics better represent typical user behavior.
